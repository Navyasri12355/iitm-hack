ABSTRACT

Background: Current guidelines recommend mammography screening for breast cancer starting at age 40-50 years, but recent evidence suggests the benefits may be smaller and harms greater than previously estimated.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and large cohort studies of mammography screening published between 1990-2024. We included 23 studies with 2.8 million women and assessed breast cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, overdiagnosis, and false positives.

Results: **CONTRADICTORY FINDING:** Mammography screening showed smaller mortality benefits than previously reported (breast cancer mortality reduction 13%, 95% CI: 8-18%) with substantial overdiagnosis (19% of screen-detected cancers, 95% CI: 15-23%) and high false positive rates (61 per 1000 screens). The number needed to screen to prevent one breast cancer death was 1,339 women over 10 years, while 259 women experienced overdiagnosis for each death prevented.

Conclusions: These findings challenge current screening recommendations and suggest that the harms of mammography screening may outweigh benefits for many women, particularly those at average risk under age 50.

INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer screening with mammography has been a cornerstone of women's preventive healthcare for over three decades. Current guidelines from major organizations recommend screening mammography starting between ages 40-50 years, with biennial or annual screening continuing until age 74-75 years.

However, the evidence base supporting these recommendations has been increasingly questioned. Recent studies have suggested that:
- Mortality benefits may be smaller than originally estimated
- Overdiagnosis rates may be higher than previously recognized
- False positive rates cause significant psychological and economic burden
- Modern breast cancer treatment may have reduced the relative benefit of early detection

**STUDY RATIONALE**

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide updated evidence on the benefits and harms of mammography screening to inform current clinical practice and guideline development.

**RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

1. What is the magnitude of breast cancer mortality reduction from mammography screening?
2. What are the rates of overdiagnosis and false positives?
3. How do benefits and harms vary by age group?
4. What is the overall balance of benefits and harms?

METHODS

Search Strategy and Study Selection

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases from January 1990 through February 2024 using terms related to mammography, breast cancer screening, and clinical outcomes.

Inclusion Criteria:
- Randomized controlled trials or large cohort studies (n≥10,000)
- Women aged 40-74 years
- Mammography screening vs no screening or usual care
- Follow-up ≥10 years
- Outcomes: breast cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, overdiagnosis, false positives

Exclusion Criteria:
- Studies in high-risk populations (BRCA mutations, strong family history)
- Studies of screening modalities other than mammography
- Studies with inadequate outcome data
- Follow-up <5 years

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

Two reviewers independently extracted data on:
- Study characteristics (design, population, intervention)
- Participant characteristics (age, risk factors)
- Outcomes (mortality, overdiagnosis, false positives)
- Study quality (using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool)

Primary Outcomes:
- Breast cancer mortality
- All-cause mortality
- Overdiagnosis (excess cancer incidence in screened vs unscreened populations)
- False positive rates

Secondary Outcomes:
- Advanced cancer detection rates
- Interval cancer rates
- Quality of life measures
- Healthcare utilization and costs

Statistical Analysis

We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics. Subgroup analyses were performed by age group, screening interval, and study design.

For overdiagnosis, we calculated the percentage of screen-detected cancers that represent overdiagnosis using the method of Puliti et al., accounting for lead time and competing mortality.

DISCUSSION

**Key Contradictory Findings:**

1. **Smaller Mortality Benefit:** Our meta-analysis found only a 13% reduction in breast cancer mortality, substantially smaller than the 20-30% reduction cited in current guidelines and used to justify screening recommendations.

2. **Higher Overdiagnosis Rates:** We found 19% of screen-detected cancers represent overdiagnosis, higher than the 10-15% typically cited and used in guideline benefit-harm calculations.

3. **No Benefit in Women 40-49:** Unlike some current guidelines that recommend screening starting at age 40, we found no significant mortality benefit in this age group.

4. **Unfavorable Harm-Benefit Ratio:** For every breast cancer death prevented, 259 women are overdiagnosed and 817 experience false positives, raising questions about the overall value of screening.

**Comparison with Current Guidelines:**

American Cancer Society (2015):
- Recommends annual screening ages 45-54, biennial 55+
- **Our findings:** Question benefit before age 50, support biennial over annual

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016):
- Recommends biennial screening ages 50-74
- **Our findings:** Support this approach but question extension to younger ages

American College of Radiology (2018):
- Recommends annual screening starting age 40
- **Our findings:** Strongly contradict this recommendation

**Potential Explanations for Contradictory Results:**

1. **Improved Treatment:** Modern breast cancer treatment may have reduced the relative benefit of early detection through screening.

2. **Lead Time Bias:** Previous studies may have overestimated benefits due to inadequate adjustment for lead time.

3. **Overdiagnosis Recognition:** Better understanding and measurement of overdiagnosis reveals previously underestimated harms.

4. **Population Changes:** Declining breast cancer incidence and competing mortality may have altered the benefit-harm balance.

**Clinical Implications:**

1. **Individualized Decision-Making:** The marginal benefits and substantial harms suggest screening decisions should be highly individualized based on patient values and preferences.

2. **Enhanced Informed Consent:** Women should be fully informed about the likelihood of false positives and overdiagnosis relative to mortality benefit.

3. **Age-Specific Recommendations:** Evidence does not support routine screening before age 50 for average-risk women.

4. **Screening Interval:** Biennial screening appears to provide most benefits with fewer harms compared to annual screening.

**Proposed Revised Recommendations:**

Based on our findings, we propose the following evidence-based recommendations:

Ages 40-49 Years:
- **Recommendation:** Screening NOT routinely recommended
- **Rationale:** No significant mortality benefit, high false positive and overdiagnosis rates
- **Exception:** Consider for women with strong preferences after thorough informed consent

Ages 50-69 Years:
- **Recommendation:** Biennial screening recommended
- **Rationale:** Modest mortality benefit with acceptable harm-benefit ratio
- **Approach:** Shared decision-making with full disclosure of benefits and harms

Ages 70+ Years:
- **Recommendation:** Individualized based on life expectancy and comorbidities
- **Rationale:** Limited evidence of benefit, increasing overdiagnosis risk
- **Consideration:** Discontinue if life expectancy <10 years

**Limitations:**

1. **Study Heterogeneity:** Included studies varied in populations, screening protocols, and outcome definitions.

2. **Temporal Changes:** Studies spanned multiple decades during which treatment and screening technology evolved.

3. **Overdiagnosis Estimation:** Overdiagnosis rates are difficult to measure precisely and may vary by population.

4. **Quality of Life:** Limited data on long-term quality of life impacts of screening harms.

5. **High-Risk Populations:** Results may not apply to women with strong family history or genetic predisposition.

CONCLUSIONS

**Primary Conclusion:**
**CONTRADICTS CURRENT GUIDELINES:** Mammography screening provides smaller mortality benefits (13% reduction) and causes greater harms (19% overdiagnosis rate) than previously estimated, challenging current recommendations for routine screening, particularly in women under age 50.

**Secondary Conclusions:**
1. No significant mortality benefit demonstrated for women aged 40-49 years
2. Biennial screening provides most benefits with fewer harms than annual screening
3. For every breast cancer death prevented, 259 women are overdiagnosed
4. Current guidelines may be causing more harm than benefit for many women

**Clinical Impact:**
These findings suggest that current mammography screening guidelines may be subjecting millions of women to unnecessary procedures, anxiety, and overtreatment. A fundamental reassessment of screening recommendations is warranted, with emphasis on:
- Raising the age for routine screening initiation to 50 years
- Implementing biennial rather than annual screening
- Enhanced informed consent processes
- Individualized decision-making based on patient values and preferences

**Recommendations for Practice:**
1. **Clinicians** should engage in thorough shared decision-making discussions about screening benefits and harms
2. **Guidelines committees** should revise recommendations based on updated evidence
3. **Researchers** should focus on developing better risk stratification tools to identify women most likely to benefit
4. **Policymakers** should consider the economic implications of current screening practices

**Future Research Priorities:**
1. Development of personalized risk prediction models
2. Investigation of alternative screening strategies (risk-based, abbreviated MRI)
3. Long-term quality of life studies in screening participants
4. Economic analyses incorporating updated benefit-harm ratios
5. Studies of screening cessation strategies in older women

EDITORIAL NOTE

This systematic review presents compelling evidence that challenges fundamental assumptions about mammography screening. The findings warrant serious consideration by guideline committees and may lead to significant changes in screening recommendations. Healthcare providers should carefully consider these results when counseling patients about screening decisions.

**CLINICAL BOTTOM LINE:**
The harms of mammography screening, including overdiagnosis and false positives, may outweigh the modest mortality benefits for many women, particularly those under age 50. Current guidelines should be revised to reflect this updated evidence, with emphasis on individualized decision-making and enhanced informed consent.
