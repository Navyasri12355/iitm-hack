Study Design: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial
Sample Size: 2,500 patients
Duration: 24 months

Objective:
To compare the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors versus ARBs in treating 
essential hypertension in adults aged 40-70.

Results:
- ACE inhibitors: 78% achieved target BP (<140/90)
- ARBs: 82% achieved target BP (<140/90)
- Side effects: ACE inhibitors 15%, ARBs 8%

Conclusion:
Both drug classes are effective, but ARBs show slightly better tolerability 
and efficacy in this population.
