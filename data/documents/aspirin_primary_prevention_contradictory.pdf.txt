ABSTRACT

Background: Current guidelines recommend aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 40-59 years with high cardiovascular risk and low bleeding risk. However, recent evidence suggests this recommendation may need revision.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) to placebo for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases through January 2024, including 15 trials with 164,225 participants.

Results: **CONTRADICTORY FINDING:** Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention showed no significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) when bleeding events were considered in net clinical benefit analysis (RR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-1.02, p=0.14). Major bleeding events significantly increased (RR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.31-1.65, p<0.001), resulting in negative net clinical benefit in most risk groups.

Conclusions: These findings challenge current guideline recommendations for aspirin in primary prevention and suggest that the bleeding risks may outweigh cardiovascular benefits for most patients without established cardiovascular disease.

INTRODUCTION

Aspirin has been a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention for decades. The 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Primary Prevention Guidelines recommend low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) for adults aged 40-59 years who are at high cardiovascular risk (≥10% 10-year ASCVD risk) and not at increased bleeding risk.

However, several recent large-scale trials have questioned the net benefit of aspirin for primary prevention, particularly when bleeding complications are fully considered. The ASPREE trial, published in 2018, showed increased mortality in elderly patients taking aspirin, while other studies have highlighted significant bleeding risks that may offset cardiovascular benefits.

**STUDY HYPOTHESIS:** We hypothesized that when all bleeding events are properly weighted in net clinical benefit analyses, aspirin for primary prevention may not provide overall benefit for most patient populations.

METHODS

Study Design and Search Strategy
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through January 31, 2024.

Search terms included: "aspirin," "acetylsalicylic acid," "primary prevention," "cardiovascular disease," "randomized controlled trial," and "placebo."

Inclusion Criteria:
- Randomized controlled trials
- Primary prevention population (no known cardiovascular disease)
- Low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) vs placebo
- Follow-up ≥2 years
- Cardiovascular and bleeding outcomes reported
- Adult participants (≥18 years)

Exclusion Criteria:
- Secondary prevention studies
- Aspirin doses >100 mg daily
- Combination therapy studies
- Follow-up <2 years
- Insufficient outcome data

Primary Outcomes:
- Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke
- Major bleeding events: intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization, and other major bleeding as defined by each trial

Secondary Outcomes:
- All-cause mortality
- Cardiovascular mortality
- Individual components of MACE
- Cancer incidence and mortality
- Net clinical benefit (cardiovascular events prevented minus major bleeding events caused)

Statistical Analysis:
We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics. Net clinical benefit was calculated by weighting cardiovascular events and bleeding events equally, as both can result in significant morbidity and mortality.

DISCUSSION

**Key Contradictory Findings:**

1. **No Cardiovascular Benefit:** Unlike previous meta-analyses that showed modest cardiovascular benefits, our comprehensive analysis found no statistically significant reduction in MACE (RR 0.94, p=0.14).

2. **Significant Bleeding Risk:** Major bleeding events increased by 47%, with particularly high rates of gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.

3. **Negative Net Clinical Benefit:** When cardiovascular events prevented are weighed against bleeding events caused, aspirin showed negative net clinical benefit across all risk groups except those with >20% 10-year ASCVD risk.

4. **Age-Related Harm:** Bleeding risks increased substantially with age, while cardiovascular benefits diminished, resulting in increasingly negative net benefit in older patients.

5. **No Mortality Benefit:** Despite theoretical cardiovascular protection, aspirin showed no significant impact on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.

**Comparison with Current Guidelines:**

The 2019 AHA/ACC Primary Prevention Guidelines recommend aspirin for adults aged 40-59 years with ≥10% 10-year ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk. Our findings directly contradict this recommendation:

- **Guideline Recommendation:** Aspirin beneficial for ≥10% ASCVD risk
- **Our Finding:** Negative net benefit even in 15-20% ASCVD risk group

- **Guideline Age Range:** 40-59 years optimal
- **Our Finding:** Negative net benefit across all age groups <70 years

- **Guideline Assumption:** Benefits outweigh bleeding risks
- **Our Finding:** Bleeding risks consistently outweigh cardiovascular benefits

**Potential Explanations for Contradictory Results:**

1. **Improved Background Therapy:** Modern cardiovascular prevention with statins, ACE inhibitors, and lifestyle interventions may have reduced the incremental benefit of aspirin.

2. **Better Bleeding Recognition:** More comprehensive bleeding event reporting in recent trials may have revealed previously underestimated bleeding risks.

3. **Population Changes:** Contemporary populations may have different bleeding risk profiles due to aging demographics and increased use of anticoagulants.

4. **Methodological Rigor:** Our analysis included more recent high-quality trials with better bleeding event adjudication.

**Clinical Implications:**

1. **Guideline Revision Needed:** Current recommendations for aspirin in primary prevention should be reconsidered given negative net clinical benefit.

2. **Risk Threshold Reconsideration:** If aspirin is to be used, the risk threshold should be raised to >20% 10-year ASCVD risk, where marginal net benefit was observed.

3. **Age Restrictions:** Aspirin should generally be avoided in adults ≥70 years for primary prevention due to substantially increased bleeding risk.

4. **Shared Decision-Making:** Enhanced patient counseling about bleeding risks is essential, as current guidelines may underestimate these risks.

5. **Alternative Strategies:** Focus should shift to proven interventions like statin therapy, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modifications.

**Limitations:**

1. **Trial Heterogeneity:** Included trials varied in population characteristics, aspirin dosing, and outcome definitions.

2. **Bleeding Event Weighting:** We weighted cardiovascular and bleeding events equally, which may not reflect patient preferences.

3. **Follow-up Duration:** Median follow-up of 6.2 years may not capture long-term benefits or risks.

4. **Publication Bias:** Potential bias toward publishing trials with significant findings.

**Subgroup Considerations:**

Despite overall negative findings, certain high-risk subgroups might still benefit:
- Patients with >20% 10-year ASCVD risk showed marginal net benefit
- Patients with strong family history of premature cardiovascular disease
- Patients with multiple high-risk features not captured in risk calculators

However, even in these groups, careful bleeding risk assessment is essential.

CONCLUSIONS

**Primary Conclusion:**
**CONTRADICTS CURRENT GUIDELINES:** Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease shows negative net clinical benefit for most patient populations when bleeding risks are properly considered. Current guideline recommendations should be revised.

**Secondary Conclusions:**
1. Major bleeding risks consistently outweigh cardiovascular benefits across most risk groups
2. No significant reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality
3. Bleeding risks increase substantially with age while benefits diminish
4. Only patients with >20% 10-year ASCVD risk showed marginal net benefit

**Clinical Impact:**
These findings suggest that millions of patients worldwide may be receiving aspirin therapy that provides net harm rather than benefit. A fundamental reassessment of aspirin's role in primary prevention is warranted, with emphasis on alternative evidence-based interventions.

**Recommendations for Clinical Practice:**
1. **Discontinue routine aspirin** for primary prevention in patients with <20% 10-year ASCVD risk
2. **Enhanced bleeding risk assessment** for all patients being considered for aspirin therapy
3. **Prioritize proven interventions** such as statin therapy, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modifications
4. **Shared decision-making** with full disclosure of bleeding risks that may outweigh cardiovascular benefits

**Future Research Directions:**
1. Development of better bleeding risk prediction tools
2. Investigation of aspirin alternatives for high-risk patients
3. Long-term follow-up studies to assess lifetime benefit-risk balance
4. Personalized medicine approaches to identify patients most likely to benefit

**CLINICAL BOTTOM LINE:**
The bleeding risks of aspirin for primary prevention consistently outweigh the cardiovascular benefits for most patients, contradicting current guidelines and suggesting that routine aspirin use should be discontinued in primary prevention except for very high-risk patients (>20% 10-year ASCVD risk) after careful bleeding risk assessment.
