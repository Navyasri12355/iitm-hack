ABSTRACT

Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have emerged as a revolutionary therapy for heart failure, demonstrating benefits across the ejection fraction spectrum. This meta-analysis synthesizes the latest evidence on SGLT-2 inhibitor efficacy and safety in heart failure patients.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published through December 2023. Primary endpoints included cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. Safety endpoints included diabetic ketoacidosis, amputation, and genitourinary infections.

Results: 12 trials involving 23,891 patients were included. SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization by 26% (HR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.68-0.81, p<0.001). Benefits were consistent across heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). All-cause mortality was reduced by 13% (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.94, p<0.001).

Conclusions: SGLT-2 inhibitors provide robust cardiovascular benefits in heart failure patients regardless of ejection fraction or diabetes status. These agents should be considered standard therapy for eligible heart failure patients.

INTRODUCTION

Heart failure affects over 6 million Americans and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Despite advances in medical therapy, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, heart failure remains a leading cause of hospitalization and death.

The introduction of SGLT-2 inhibitors has transformed heart failure management. Originally developed as glucose-lowering agents for diabetes, these medications demonstrated unexpected cardiovascular benefits in landmark trials. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial first showed cardiovascular benefits of empagliflozin in diabetic patients, leading to investigation in dedicated heart failure populations.

Subsequent trials including DAPA-HF, EMPEROR-Reduced, DELIVER, and EMPEROR-Preserved have established SGLT-2 inhibitors as foundational therapy for heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum. This meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of SGLT-2 inhibitor efficacy and safety in heart failure.

RESULTS

Study Characteristics
12 trials met inclusion criteria, enrolling 23,891 patients. Mean age was 67.2 years, 35% were female, and 45% had diabetes. Mean ejection fraction was 38.2% (range 27-65%). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 4.2 years (median 18 months).

Included trials:
- DAPA-HF (n=4,744): Dapagliflozin in HFrEF
- EMPEROR-Reduced (n=3,730): Empagliflozin in HFrEF  
- DELIVER (n=6,263): Dapagliflozin in HFpEF
- EMPEROR-Preserved (n=5,988): Empagliflozin in HFpEF
- SOLOIST-WHF (n=1,222): Sotagliflozin in acute heart failure
- 7 additional smaller trials (n=1,944)

Primary Efficacy Outcomes

Cardiovascular Death or Heart Failure Hospitalization
SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly reduced the composite primary endpoint by 26% (HR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.68-0.81, p<0.001, I²=12%). This translates to 52 fewer events per 1,000 patient-years treated.

Number needed to treat: 19 patients for 2 years to prevent one cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization.

Subgroup analyses:
- HFrEF (EF ≤40%): HR 0.71 (95% CI: 0.64-0.79)
- HFpEF (EF >40%): HR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.89)
- Diabetes: HR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.64-0.81)
- No diabetes: HR 0.76 (95% CI: 0.68-0.85)

All subgroups showed consistent benefit (p for interaction >0.05).

Individual Components:
- Cardiovascular death: HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78-0.95, p=0.003)
- Heart failure hospitalization: HR 0.70 (95% CI: 0.63-0.78, p<0.001)
- First heart failure hospitalization: HR 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61-0.76, p<0.001)
- Recurrent heart failure hospitalizations: HR 0.65 (95% CI: 0.57-0.74, p<0.001)

Secondary Efficacy Outcomes

All-Cause Mortality
SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality by 13% (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.94, p<0.001, I²=0%). This represents 18 fewer deaths per 1,000 patient-years.

Renal Outcomes
Composite renal endpoint (sustained ≥50% decline in eGFR, end-stage renal disease, or renal death): HR 0.62 (95% CI: 0.53-0.72, p<0.001)

DISCUSSION

This comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrates that SGLT-2 inhibitors provide substantial cardiovascular benefits in heart failure patients across the ejection fraction spectrum. The 26% reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization is clinically meaningful and consistent across subgroups.

Key Findings:

1. Universal Benefit: SGLT-2 inhibitors benefit both HFrEF and HFpEF patients, filling a critical therapeutic gap in HFpEF management.

2. Diabetes-Independent Effects: Benefits occur regardless of diabetes status, confirming that cardiovascular effects are independent of glucose-lowering.

3. Mortality Benefit: The 13% reduction in all-cause mortality represents a significant survival advantage.

4. Rapid Onset: Benefits emerge within weeks to months, suggesting mechanisms beyond glucose lowering.

5. Acceptable Safety Profile: While some adverse events increase (genital infections, rare ketoacidosis), the benefit-risk ratio strongly favors treatment.

Mechanisms of Benefit:
The cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors likely involve multiple mechanisms:
- Osmotic diuresis and natriuresis
- Improved cardiac energetics
- Reduced cardiac fibrosis and inflammation  
- Enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial function
- Favorable effects on cardiac metabolism

Clinical Implications:

1. Standard of Care: SGLT-2 inhibitors should be considered foundational therapy for heart failure patients with EF ≤40% and strongly considered for HFpEF patients.

2. Early Initiation: Given rapid onset of benefits, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be initiated early in the heart failure trajectory.

3. Broad Eligibility: Most heart failure patients are candidates unless contraindicated (type 1 diabetes, severe renal impairment, recurrent ketoacidosis).

4. Guideline Integration: Current heart failure guidelines should be updated to reflect SGLT-2 inhibitors as Class I recommendations.

Comparison with Other Heart Failure Therapies:
The magnitude of benefit with SGLT-2 inhibitors is comparable to or exceeds that of established heart failure therapies:
- ACE inhibitors: ~20% reduction in CV death/HF hospitalization
- Beta-blockers: ~35% reduction in mortality (HFrEF)
- MRAs: ~30% reduction in CV death/HF hospitalization
- SGLT-2 inhibitors: ~26% reduction in CV death/HF hospitalization

Economic Considerations:
Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest SGLT-2 inhibitors are cost-effective in heart failure, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $25,000-$45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

Limitations:
1. Most trials enrolled patients with stable chronic heart failure; data in acute heart failure are limited.
2. Long-term safety data (>4 years) are limited.
3. Racial and ethnic diversity was limited in some trials.
4. Real-world effectiveness may differ from clinical trial efficacy.

Future Directions:
1. Acute heart failure studies
2. Combination with newer agents (vericiguat, omecamtiv mecarbil)
3. Pediatric heart failure populations
4. Long-term safety surveillance
5. Biomarker-guided therapy selection

CONCLUSIONS

This meta-analysis provides compelling evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors represent a major advance in heart failure therapy. The consistent benefits across ejection fraction categories, diabetes status, and demographic subgroups support their use as foundational therapy for most heart failure patients.

The favorable benefit-risk profile, with significant reductions in cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality, establishes SGLT-2 inhibitors as essential components of guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure.

Clinicians should strongly consider SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for eligible heart failure patients, recognizing that these agents provide benefits beyond traditional heart failure medications and represent a paradigm shift in heart failure management.
