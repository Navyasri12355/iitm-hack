Abstract:
This systematic review examines the effectiveness of various diabetes management 
strategies in primary care settings. We analyzed 45 randomized controlled trials

Key Findings:
- Metformin remains first-line therapy with 85% efficacy
- Lifestyle interventions show 70% improvement in HbA1c levels
- Patient education programs reduce complications by 40%

Conclusion:
Comprehensive diabetes management combining medication, lifestyle changes, and 
patient education provides optimal outcomes in primary care settings.
